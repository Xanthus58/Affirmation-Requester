This is a small application I slapped together within 10 minutes because I was bored; it makes an API call to https://www.affirmations.dev/ and https://inspirobot.me/ to get an affirmation/motivational quote... That's it <3

Run the installer/Run Me First application this will download all of the necessary files like python and some pip libraries
Run affirmations.py to get your affirmation
Run the uninstaller to remove everything installed in the Run Me First application.


You can now install the standalone application by typing 
```
winget install Xanthus58.AfformationRequester
```
In your command terminal
